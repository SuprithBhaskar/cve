Microsoft scripting engines render when handling objects in memory in
Microsoft browsers. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such
a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of
the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the
vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If
the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an
attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take
control of an affected system. An attacker could then install

full user rights. This vulnerability is different from those described
